 Human-computer interaction (HCI) through gesture recognition offers an alternative
 paradigm to traditional input methods, such as the mouse and keyboard, presenting a
 more accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly interface. It also enables users to perform
 tasks more rapidly with enhanced time efficiency while, at the same time, being less
 device-intensive, reducing dependency on traditional input devices. Additionally, this
 approach is advantageous for the elderly and disabled, who may find conventional in
terfaces challenging. In this project, we propose a novel approach to HCI by training
 a deep learning model and aim to utilize this model to identify user hand gestures
 in real time through a webcam, thereby enabling seamless interaction with the com
puter. The primary goal of the project is to develop a software application capable
 of recognizing specific hand gestures and triggering predefined actions based on the
 identified gestures. While extensive research has been conducted on gesture recog
nition using deep learning, practical applications in the form of software solutions
 remain limited. The proposed system extends beyond existing applications, such as
 presentation sliding, automatic media player control, and virtual touchless keyboards,
 by focusing on the development of a versatile software tool. Unlike existing systems
 that often target singular tasks, our approach aims to automate a range of impor
tant and frequently used actions within the computer environment. Additionally, the
 project includes the creation of a user-friendly interface that visually guides users on
 the appropriate hand gestures to trigger specific actions. Through this project, we
 aim to contribute to the advancement of HCI technologies, providing a robust and
 versatile tool that not only enhances accessibility but also streamlines user interaction
 with computers by leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision.
